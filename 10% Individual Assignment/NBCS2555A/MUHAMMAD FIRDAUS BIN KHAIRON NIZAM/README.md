## 1. INTRODUCTION

Performance testing is a fundamental practice for evaluating the reliability, responsiveness, and scalability of modern web applications. As web-based platforms increasingly handle concurrent user interactions such as flight searches, form submissions, and online transactions, understanding how these systems behave under varying levels of demand becomes essential for delivering a seamless user experience. This project focuses on analyzing the performance of a demo travel booking website, specifically BlazeDemo (https://blazedemo.com), which simulates a real-world flight reservation process. Unlike traditional performance testing approaches that target static pages or simple endpoints, this study incorporates a complete user journey involving dynamic interactions such as selecting departure and arrival cities, choosing a flight from a list, and completing a purchase form. The main objectives of this study are:

* To evaluate system performance under expected normal user loads through load testing

* To determine the application's breaking point by progressively increasing user concurrency beyond normal limits

* To assess system behavior during sudden, unexpected traffic surges using spike testing

Through these tests, this project aims to identify performance bottlenecks, measure response times, and provide insights into the application's overall stability and capacity for handling real-world usage patterns.

## 2.METHODOLOGY
This section outlines the systematic approach taken to conduct performance testing and bottleneck analysis on the BlazeDemo web application using Apache JMeter. The methodology is divided into five phases: test environment setup, test script development, test scenario design, test execution, and results analysis.

### 2.1 Test Environment Setup
Before conducting any performance tests, the testing environment was properly configured to ensure accurate and repeatable results. The following tools and specifications were used:

| Component | Specification |
| :---         |     :---:      |
| Testing Tool |	Apache JMeter (latest version) |
|Target Application	| BlazeDemo (https://blazedemo.com) |
|Operating System |	macOS |
| Network |	Stable internet connection |
| Listeners	| View Results Tree, Summary Report, Aggregate Report |

Additionally, necessary JMeter plugins were installed, and the system was verified to have sufficient memory and processing power to simulate the required number of virtual users without becoming a bottleneck itself.


### 2.2. Test Script Development 
A realistic user journey was scripted in JMeter to accurately simulate how a real user would interact with the BlazeDemo website. The complete end-to-end workflow consisted of the following sequential HTTP requests:

| Step | Action | Endpoint/Path |
| :---         |     :---:      |     :---:      |
|1	| Access the homepage |	/ |
|2	| Select departure and arrival cities	| /reserve.php |
|3	| Choose a specific flight | /purchase.php |
|4	|Fill in passenger and payment details	|/purchase.php (POST)|
|5	|Confirm booking and receive confirmation	|/confirmation.php|

The script was developed using two methods:

* BlazeMeter Chrome Extension: Used to record the complete user journey and export it as a .jmx file.

* Manual Construction: HTTP Request samplers were manually added and configured in JMeter for greater control and understanding.

To simulate realistic user behavior, think times (pauses between actions) were added using the Constant Timer or Gaussian Random Timer in JMeter.

### 2.3 Test Scenario Design
Three distinct performance test scenarios were designed to evaluate different aspects of the application's behavior under load. Each scenario was configured using JMeter's Thread Group with specific parameters.

#### 2.3.1 Load Test - 
The load test was designed to simulate expected normal operating conditions. The goal was to establish a baseline performance metric.

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :---: |
| Number of Threads (Users) | 50 |
| Ramp-Up Period | 60 seconds |
| Loop Count | Infinite |
| Duration | ~5 minutes |
| Test Objective | Measure response times, throughput, and error rate under normal load |

      
#### 2.3.2 Stress Test - 
The stress test aimed to push the application beyond its normal capacity to identify the breaking point and observe failure behavior.

| Parameter	| Value |
| :--- | :---: |
| Number of Threads (Users)	| 500 |
| Ramp-Up Period	| 120 seconds |
| Loop Count	| Infinite |
| Duration	| ~20 minutes |
| Test Objective	| Determine maximum user capacity and observe degradation patterns |

#### 2.3.3 Endurance Test - 
The endurance test was designed to simulate sustained normal-to-peak traffic over an extended period to identify memory leaks, resource fragmentation, and degradation over time.

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :---: |
| Number of Threads (Users)	| 100 |
| Ramp-Up Period |60 Seconds |
| Loop Count | Infinite cycles |
| Duration | 1 Hour |
| Test Objective	| Detect memory leaks, resource exhaustion, and performance degradation over prolonged operation. | 


### 2.4 Test Execution
All tests were executed using JMeter in non-GUI (command-line) mode to maximize performance and resource efficiency. The following command was used for each test

* Load Test <br/>

      bash
      ./jmeter -n -t /Users/void/Documents/ITT440/Individual\ Assignment/Blazedemotest.jmx -l /Users/void/Documents/ITT440/Individual\    
       Assignment/LoadTestV3.csv  -e -o /Users/void/Documents/ITT440/Individual\ Assignment/LoadTestV3
  
* Stress Test <br/>

      bash
      ./jmeter -n -t /Users/void/Documents/ITT440/Individual\ Assignment/Blazedemotest.jmx -l /Users/void/Documents/ITT440/Individual\    
       Assignment/StressTestV3.csv  -e -o /Users/void/Documents/ITT440/Individual\ Assignment/StressTestV3
  
* Endurance Test <br/>


       bash
      ./jmeter -n -t /Users/void/Documents/ITT440/Individual\ Assignment/Blazedemotest.jmx -l /Users/void/Documents/ITT440/Individual\    
       Assignment/EnduranceTestV5.csv  -e -o /Users/void/Documents/ITT440/Individual\ Assignment/EnduranceTestV5
  
Before each test, the following steps were performed:

* The application (BlazeDemo) was verified to be accessible and responsive.

* System resources (CPU, memory, network) on the testing machine were monitored to ensure they were not interfering with results.

* A warm-up run was conducted to allow Just-In-Time compilation and caching mechanisms to stabilize.

* Each test was executed three times to ensure consistency and reliability of results. The average values were then calculated for analysis.

### 2.5 Results Collection and Analysis
During and after each test execution, performance data was collected using JMeter listeners and the generated HTML report. The key performance metrics analyzed included:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total Requests | Total number of HTTP requests sent during the test |
| Error Rate | Percentage of failed requests (0% indicates no failures) |
| Average Response | Mean response time across all requests (good range: <500ms) |
| Min Response | Fastest recorded response time |
| Max Response | Slowest recorded response time (acceptable range: <3000ms) |
| Median | Middle value where 50% of requests are faster and 50% are slower |
| 90th Percentile | 90% of requests completed faster than this value |
| 95th Percentile | 95% of requests completed faster than this value |
| 99th Percentile | 99% of requests completed faster than this value |
| Throughput | Number of transactions successfully processed per second |

Bottlenecks were identified by analyzing which steps in the user journey exhibited the highest response times or error rates under increasing load. Potential causes such as network latency, server processing limits, or application code inefficiencies were considered.

## 4. FINAL CONCLUSION

BlazeDemo is a **stable and reliable** web application that maintains **0% error rate** under all tested conditions (load, stress, and spike). The application performs **well under normal load** (366ms average, 635ms at 99th percentile). However, under **stress and spike conditions**, the 99th percentile response times exceed acceptable thresholds (1.02-2.4 seconds), with the **homepage and flight selection** identified as critical bottlenecks.

**Production Readiness:** ✅ Suitable for low-to-medium traffic environments. ⚠️ Not recommended for high-traffic or flash sale events without optimization of the identified bottlenecks.
